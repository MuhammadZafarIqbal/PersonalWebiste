            We all need a break from our everyday

            life going on a vacation is fun and
            
            fulfilling but you can gain a lot more
            
            by actually traveling exploring and
            
            being present at the places you visit
            
            here are some benefits of traveling it
            
            is better to spend your money on
            
            experiences rather than on material
            
            things the memories you collector like
            
            treasures they will remain forever and
            
            will bring you more happiness than some
            
            new clothes or other material things
            
            think how good it will feel when you're
            
            old and you look back to see not only an
            
            ordinary routine but also adventures and
            
            unique experiences you had gone through
            
            and not only when you're old ever a few
            
            years from now you can recall how much
            
            fun you had and plan your next adventure
            
            in the end you will not regret the
            
            things you've done but the things you
            
            didn't do traveling is a great
            
            opportunity to temporarily get away from
            
            your everyday life and look at it from a
            
            different point of view it's so much
            
            easier to deal with issues and solve
            
            problems when you look at them from the
            
            outside while traveling you have a lot
            
            of time to think without distractions
            
            and make healthy decisions you will have
            
            a better perspective and maybe even
            
            realize that things are not that bad as
            
            you thought in our everyday life we are
            
            used to doing the same things meeting
            
            the same people going to the same places
            
            we basically live in our comfort zone
            
            when you travel you get out of your
            
            bubble you meet new people other

            diverse and it helps you understand
            
            people that are different from you
            
            traveling actually makes you smarter you
            
            learn new things all the time
